# New IEEE Website
Started: January 18th, 2024

## Link to the Currently Active (Old) Site
http://ieee.ece.tufts.edu/

## Setting up the project
1. Check if you have Node.js (and Node Package Manager) installed by running `npm -v`. If you don't have it installed, please download and install it here: [Node.js Installation Page](https://nodejs.org/en).
2. Install project dependencies for this project by running `npm install`. This should create a new node_modules directory in your project. This folder should be ignored inside your repository, do not push it to GitHub.
3. You're now ready to start developing! If you visit the site without running Tailwind, you'll notice that there's no styling whatsoever. You can have Tailwind constantly rebuild the CSS while you're developing by running `npm run tailwind`. 
4. You can view the site locally by either opening and reloading the HTML manually or by using a simple HTTP server. A popular extension in VSCode to generate a simple local server is "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.

## Getting Started with HTML/CSS/JS
Here's some slides I used to introduce devs in JumboCode to HTML/CSS/JS: [Google Slides Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1prUMkU-5pIiUyRpJRSH1Fm86SfCj2NVMEpMQUW_LdGk/edit?usp=sharing)

I'm not sure how useful they'll be without commentary so I'd suggest trying to learn the basics on your own. If you ever need help, don't hesistate to ask!
